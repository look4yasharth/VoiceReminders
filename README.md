# Voice Reminders
This watchOS application that I built uses SiriKit and it allow users to record their voice for reminders and audio storage in general for later purpose. User can even use emojis. It also allows user to select from a list of pre-written options.

The constraints of Apple Watch made this project quite interesting. Not only did I have a very limited screen space to work withbut also I had a very short attention span from the user. 

In this project , I learnt to use SiriKit and about Recording and saving audio input, speech to text input, pre-set text input, file management and saving files.
